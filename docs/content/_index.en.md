Welcome to our Python 3 workshop! We are thrilled to have you join us on this exciting journey into the world of Python programming. Python is a versatile and widely-used language that powers various applications, from web development to data science, machine learning, and beyond.
In this workshop, we will cover the fundamentals of Python 3 to help you build a strong foundation in programming. Our aim is to equip you with the skills and knowledge necessary to understand and write efficient Python code for various applications.
Some topics that we'll explore include:

* Introduction to Python: history, features, and applications
* Python basics: data types, variables, and operators
* Control structures: conditionals, loops, and error handling
* Functions: defining and calling functions, recursion, and lambda functions
* Object-oriented programming: classes, objects, and inheritance
* Modules and packages: importing and using external libraries

Throughout the workshop, you will have the opportunity to apply your learning through hands-on exercises, quizzes, and interactive activities. We encourage active participation and collaboration with fellow participants to make the most out of this learning experience.
By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of Python 3 and be well-prepared to dive deeper into more advanced topics or tackle real-world projects with confidence.
We hope you're as excited as we are to embark on this Python 3 adventure together!
